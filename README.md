# Welcome!

This is a simple chat interface I made in like... 2 hours?? Just for easier and more convenient access to my chatbot while developing it.

More updates to come!

Project Francium is a project I started in order to create an omnipotent virtual assistant/friend.
This chat interface will be one of the many interfaces I will create to interact with the chatbot.
I also aspire to create my own model, though that will be in the backlog for a while.
